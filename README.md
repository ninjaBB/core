NinjaBB Forum Application
====

What is NinjaBB?
====
NinjaBB is a Free and Open Source Forum Application. It is designed to be as fast as it can be, modern, beautiful designed,
user-friendly and very very extensible.

On what stage is it?
====
It is currently on development stage. We are still working (in fact, there are only plans :)) on it.

When it will be released?
====
Who know? We certainly not.

What features are planned?
====
It will be a very powerful application. It will contain all what "standard" concurence have - multi level forums, permissions,
styles, private messages, poll topics, quick reply, etc.
Also some unique features are: Alerts System, Achievments, Likes, Social Networks Connection, responsive layout and much more.

Can I suggest something?
====
Yes, you can. But not now. We have not started coding it... It is no sense, but in nearly future - we will need you!
